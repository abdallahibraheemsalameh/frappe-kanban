# Vue.js + Frappe Kanban Integration – Implementation Summary

## Implementation Approach

- I built a **Vue 3 + TypeScript Kanban board** using [`vuedraggable`](https://github.com/SortableJS/vue.draggable.next), styled with modern CSS.
- The board fetches `Sales Order` documents from the **Frappe REST API** and organizes them by delivery day.
- When a card is dragged to a different column, the `delivery_date` of that `Sales Order` is updated using a PATCH request to the Frappe API.

## Frappe Integration

- ⚠️ I did **not** create a custom Frappe app.
- I used the **existing Frappe REST API** to interact with the built-in `Sales Order` DocType.
- The **backend remained unchanged** — all logic and UI are handled in the Vue frontend.

## Structure

### Core Components

- `components/kanban-board.vue`: Main component rendering the columns and cards with modern UI design.

### Services

- `services/frappe.ts`: Abstracted API functions to fetch and update `Sales Order` records.

### Styling

- `styles/kanban-board.css`: Comprehensive styling for the Kanban board with modern design, animations, and responsive layout.

### Domain Layer

- `domain/`: Contains domain-specific definitions and metadata for better code organization.

### Features

- The board displays **7 columns**, one for each weekday, and maps orders by their delivery date.
- Modern design with smooth animations and hover effects.
- Drag and drop functionality with visual feedback.
- Real-time order count display for each day.

## Assumptions

- The Frappe server exposes `GET` and `PUT` access on `/api/resource/Sales Order`.
- CORS and CSRF settings were configured on the backend to allow API access from `http://localhost:5173`.
- The user has the required permissions to view and update `Sales Order` records.
